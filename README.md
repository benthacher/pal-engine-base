# PAL Engine Base Project

This project shows how to setup a project using the PAL engine. To begin, fork this repo and implement the functions in `pal.c` according to the project's desired backend. An example using SDL2 exists on the branch `sdl2-example`.

Don't get too attached to anything you make with the engine as it's still very basic and the interfaces exposed in `pal.c/.h` will likely be changed in this stage of development.

## Usage

As long as all prerequisites are installed (cmake and python), the `setup.sh` script can be run to initialize the PAL submodule and utilities used in it.
